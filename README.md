# Project description #

UltraTeamMV is a project developped by Enzo MOLION & LÃ©o VALLETTE during [Polytech Grenoble](https://www.polytech-grenoble.fr/)'s [RICM4](https://www.polytech-grenoble.fr/menu-principal/formations/reseaux-informatiques-et-communication-multimedia/) courses.

This project (2017-18 version of [UltraTeam](https://air.imag.fr/index.php/UltraTeam)) consists of :

- A BLE & LoRa decentralized protocol conception and implementation,
- A web application development.
This solution should allow a hikers team to localize each other in real time.
It is developed in synergy with another [UltraTeam 2018 project](http://air.imag.fr/index.php/RICM4_2017_2018_-_UltraTeam_7.1/).

A more detailled description is available on the [AIR page](https://air.imag.fr/index.php/RICM4_2017_2018_-_UltraTeamMV) of the project.
